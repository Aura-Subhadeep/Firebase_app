This repository contains various web apps that I have created using JavaScript. They are:

- Calculator App : This is a simple calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using JavaScript. I wrote this app as a learning project to practice my web development skills.
- Todo List App : This is a simple web app that lets you create and manage your personal todo list. You can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as done. The app uses JavaScript and Firebase for the back-end.
- Weather App: This is a web app that shows you the current weather and forecast for any location. You can enter a city name to get the weather information. The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch the data and displays it in a simple and elegant interface.
