This repository contains various web apps that I have created using JavaScript. They are:

- Grocery List: A web app that lets you create and manage your grocery list using JavaScript and Firebase.
- Weather App: This is a web app that shows you the current weather and forecast for any location. You can enter a city name to get the weather information. The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch the data and displays it in a simple and elegant interface.
